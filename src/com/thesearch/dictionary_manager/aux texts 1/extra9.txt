  An adaptation of Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST from the director of THE

characters, and text of the original in which Prospero, Duke of Milan, after 12
years of forced exile on a remote island, plans a revenge and then a
reconciliation with his enemies.  The film is called PROSPERO'S BOOKS because
it is structured around 24 magic volumes that Prospero's friend, Gonzalo,
hurriedly put into Prospero's boat as a charitable act to ease his exile.

exile into an eclectic haven of Renaissance learning, pictorial imagery and
classical mythology.  Had to bow out of the Cannes Film Festival due to the 
complex special effects being incomplete.   Shot in HDTV and partially financed
by NHK.   Has some wild visual effects via Quantel's video paintbox. Opened in

D.P.s: Takao Saito, Masaharu Ueda
Start Date: 7/3/90, Chichibu, Gotemba, Izu, Nagasaki, Tokyo
  The film tells the tale of a group of four children who spend their summer
vacation with their grandmother, who is a survivor of the atomic bomb dropped
on Nagasaki.  There is a common Japanese belief that the bombing of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki were unjustifiable acts of American terrorism, and had nothing to
do with ending the war.  The youngest child becomes deeply resentful of the
U.S. when he learns that the bomb killed his grandfather.  But his feelings are
confused when an American uncle, played by Richard Gere (speaking Japanese),
visits from Hawaii.   Gere is shocked to learn that his grandmother lost her
husband in the bombing, and asks, on behalf of the U.S., for her forgiveness,
which she happily gives.   
  The film was savaged by foreign journalists at a preview screening in Tokyo,
claiming that Kurosawa was ignoring Japan's role in starting the war by bombing
Pearl Harbor and massacring hundreds of thousands in Nanking and Manila. 
Kurosawa explained that he was not attempting to defend Japan's role in the
war.  "This is a film about a family - not war or peace".   The moral of the
tale was intended to be that it is the leaders of countries, and not the
ordinary people, who are responsible for wars.

Producer: Michael D. Pariser
Screenplay: Ken Russell, Deborah Dalton, based on the play "Bondage" by David

Start Date: 8/20/90, Los Angeles
  Theresa Russell is an L.A. prostitute who takes on a sordid assortment of
men in cars.  She gives a running commentary of her experiences directly to the
camera.  Apparently this film lacks the usual style and verve of Ken Russell's
projects.  The filmmakers are very distraught by the rating, as they feel that
all of the young women who were captivated by PRETTY WOMAN should see this
film, which is far more realistic.

  This biopic headlining Downey as Charlie Chaplin has jumped from

Academy Award.   Downey will age from 19 to 83 in the process.   Aykroyd plays
Mack Sennett (of Keystone Kops fame), Geraldine Chaplin plays her real

Goodall, Amber Scott, Dick Monahan
Producer: Frank Marshall, Kathleen Kennedy, Gerald R. Molen
Screenplay: Jim V. Hart, Malia Scotch Marmo
D.P.: Dean Cundey
Start Date: 2/19/91, Los Angeles
Negative Cost: $68 million
  In this sequel to PETER PAN, Hoffman is Capt. Hook, Williams is a grown-up
Peter Pan (attorney), Roberts is Tinker Bell, Hoskins is Smee and Smith is Gran
Wendy.  Capt. Hook and Peter now fight as 35-year old equals.  Film features 
spectacular sets and Visual Effects from ILM.  Aa Tinker Bell, Roberts will 
not work with any of the rest of the cast, but in front of a bluescreen.  Her 
wings will be animated separately and matted into her shots.   Huge outlook.  
Spielberg last directed INDIANA JONES AND THE LAST CRUSADE.   Film is way 
over budget and schedule.  Outrageous contract terms for Spielberg and Messrs 
Hoffman and Williams have the trio taking more of the revenue than TriStar!   
(About 40% of the gross).  Some have speculated that the film would have to
gross some $500 million to break even!   (That's somewhat inflated, methinks).
Carrie Fisher wrote Tinkerbell's dialogue and also did a script polish.  
They will have a heckuva time meeting the December 11th date, so there has 
been talk of a 12/18 or 12/25 opening.   The producers are adamant about 
releasing the film this year, though.  (Visions of Oscars dancing in their 
heads?)    The producers plan to release HOOK in formats galore: 70mm SR, 70mm
Dolby A, 70mm CDS, 35mm SR, 35mm Dolby A, 35mm CDS.

D.P.: Jost Vacano
Start Date: 7/9/90, New York, Rome, Budapest, London, Los Angeles
Negative Cost: $70 million
  This action comedy has had a very difficult gestation.  Willis is
an ex-safe cracker duped into stealing priceless DaVinci originals.  Silver 
certainly knows how to spend the bucks. Visual Effects courtesy of ILM.    
Big, Big Outlook.  Lehmann directed HEATHERS and MEET THE APPLEGATES.

while  is still and infant.  If it succeeds, three billion people will die in a

talk that the film needed a month of reshoots, but those plans were scuttled

chapter in the series, which is a stunning continuation of the story both 
creatively and technologically".   Film has been twice delayed, from

Start Date: 1/92
  A sexy female vampire with a conscience who does not feed on innocent people. 
One of her most ruthless victims, a mob boss, survives her attack and is
transformed into an even more insidious vampire whom she must destroy with the
aid of an undercover cop.  "Vampire noir" is how this project has been
classified.   Parillaud scored big in LA FEMME NIKITA.  Landis characterizes
the film as "Goodfellas meets Dracula".  Roger Corman is also starting a film
by the same title.

M. BUTTERFLY						1993
Dir: David Cronenberg
Cast: TBA
Exec. Producer: David Geffen

  Cronenberg seems oddly correct to direct the big-screen version of the
Tony-winning play about a French diplomat who was jailed for treason having

RECKLESS KELLY						1992

Producers: Yahoo Serious, Warwick Ross
Screenplay: Yahoo Serious
Start Date: 9/91, Australia
  Why would Warner Brothers finance another picture from Yahoo Serious after

inexpensive, and he is very popular Down Unde, that's why.

  A huge-scale, rather comic look at the legend of Robin Hood and his merry
men.  This production boasts the hottest name in filmdom today in
Costner.  Freeman is his sidekick.  Rickman, the perfect heavy, is the Sheriff
of Nottingham.  Mastrantonio makes a fetching Maid Marion.  This is the second
entrant in the battle of the Robin Hoods (three different attempted
productions, two actually made).  Now it's up to the public to decide.... 
Opens on 2100 screens.  Sneaked in Sacramento on 3/27 with the best preview results 
in Warner Brothers history.  68% of the preview cards rated it "excellent", 30%
were "very good".  Film re-cut in May due to Mr. Rickman "stealing the show" as
the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Opens in London on July 19.  Recorded in Q-Sound.

Vogler, Sam Neill, Ernie Dingo, David Gulpilil, Lois Chiles, Allen Garfield
Producers: Jonathan Taplin, Anatole Dauman
Screenplay: Wim Wenders, Peter Carey
D.P.: Robby Muller
Start Date: 4/20/90, Venice Italy, France, Portugal, U.S., Japan, Australia,
Germany, USSR, China, Mali
Negative Cost: $23 million
  A huge-scale science fiction romance/road story filmed around the 
world in nine countries by Berlin's great Wim Wenders.  This futuristic (set 
in 1999) thriller concerns a man's efforts to retrieve a valuable invention 
(a device to permit blind people to see recorded images) and a woman's pursuit
of the mysterious man she loves.   Moreau plays Hurt's blind mother, Von Sydow 
is his father. Production was to have been in 65mm, but the demanding location 
requirements resulted in a 35mm production.  Title song is by the Irish group 
U2.  Other acts on the soundtrack include Neneh Cherry, Lou Reed, R.E.M., Patti
Smith, Peter Gabriel and Robbie Robertson. Early notices are quite positive 
on some aspects, but mixed on others.   Film runs a epic 178 minutes and 
apparently seems somewhat truncated at that length.  Wenders also has a 
five-hour cut that he would like to make the film festival rounds and on home 
video.  Opened in Germany to mixed business in September.  Reviews in Berlin 
were dreadful, they loved it in Munich.

Start Date: 8/13/91, New Mexico
  This thriller features Dafoe as a small-town sheriff whose seemingly 
routine investigation into a murder balloons into an intricate plot involving 
the FBI and the CIA.

unseen).  Film involves three separate interrelated stories inspired by the

York's Angelika Film Center.  Brilliant winner of the Sundance Film Festival.
